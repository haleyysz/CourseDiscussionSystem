            <p>A help system (sometimes called a help file ) is a documentation component of a software program that explains
                the features of the program and helps the user understand its capabilities. A bit like an extensive, organized,
                and thorough collection of FAQ s (frequently asked questions), the help system's purpose is to provide the answers
                that a user needs to understand to use the program effectively.

            <p>• Only the instructor has privilege to do so, if you are an instructor, you can select a discussion or a comment, and you will
                find there is a little setting button lying on the right, just click it and it will show you drop down menu, and  you just need to

              </p>
        </div><p>• An instructor can create, view and terminate a discussion</p>
        <p>• Each discussion must have a unique identifier.
        The identifier for a discussion includes the username of the creator, a course name (e.g., “CS 451 User
            Interface Design”), a topic (e.g., “User Profiles”), and the date and time of creation.</p>
        <p>• An instructor can add an entry (text or image) to a discussion.</p>
        <p>•
        An  instructor  who  is  the  creator  of  the  discussion  is  the  only  person  who  can  delete  any  entry  of  a
        discussion.  As an example, when a student posts something that is not relevant or correct, the creator
            may decide to remove it.</p>
        <p>•
        An instructor can search and/or view any discussion.  The search parameters include one or more of
            elements comprising the unique identifier of discussion mentioned above.</p>

        <h2 class="purple">As an Beginner</h2>
        <p>
            •
            These users are assumed to be freshmen students and they are allowed to participate only the discussion
            for  one  course.   Accordingly,  each  beginner  account  includes  the  course  in  which  the  beginner  has
            registered.  For example, a beginner might have registered for “CS 120 Software Design I”; so this person
            is allowed to search and view a discussion as well as to add a text to a discussion (text only and not
            any image) but it must be associated with the course “CS 120 Software Design I”. Notice that a course
            may have multiple discussions each having a different topic, and/or date and time.  So a beginner may
            participate in more than one discussion for the same course.

           <p>
        • A beginner should be able to view his/her account details which shows username and the course he/she
        has registered in but not the password.</p>

           <p>• A beginner may ask for help on how to select a discussion, to add a text or to view account details.</p>

        <h2 class="purple">As an Intermediate</h2>
        <p>•
            These users are assumed to be sophomores or juniors who have been around for a while and have some
            experience in using the discussion groups.  The same help facility provided to the beginners must also
            be available for intermediate users although they might not use it often.</p>
        <p>•
            An intermediate user is allowed to participate in more than one discussion (search and view discussions
            as well as add text to the discussions - again text only but no image) but for only those courses in which
            the user has registered.  Consequently,  their accounts must include the courses in which the user has
            registered.</p>
        <p>•
            An  intermediate  user  should  be  able  to  view  his/her  account  details  to  see  what  courses  he/she  has
            registered.  Again, the display should only show the username and the courses, but not the password.</p>
